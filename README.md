# 1. Product Overview
  The system aims to automate and standardize the process of requesting daily allowances and fuel values for public servant travel.
  It eliminates calculation errors, reduces form completion time, and ensures compliance with current municipal legislation.
  Additionally, it creates a historical repository of trips and requests, facilitating future analyses, audits, and automatic form filling.
# 2. Target Audience
  Internal: Municipal departments, especially the Social Development Department of Bocaiúva/MG (starting point).
  External: Public sector in general (city halls, municipal councils, autarchies, small and medium-sized state agencies).

# 3. Problem to be Solved

  High rate of manual errors in calculating daily allowances and fuel
  Repetitive and time-consuming manual form completion
  Lack of standardization in forms
  Difficulty retrieving information from previous trips
  Risk of non-compliance with municipal law/daily allowance regulations

# 4. Product Objectives

Automate calculations based on municipal daily allowance legislation
Ensure compliance with specific rules (position, destination, distance, overnight stay, etc.)
